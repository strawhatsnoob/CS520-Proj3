I've implemented the Load/Store queue, Reorder buffer and Memory Access Unit in this project. The LSQ implementation was carried out through different stages of the out-of-order APEX simulator like dispatch, LSQ and MAU. LSQ and LSQEntry structs were initiated in the 'apex_cpu.h' file. A separate stage called LSQ has been implemented in 'apex_cpu.c' file to implement the LSQ stage logic.
